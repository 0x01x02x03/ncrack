TODO:

* Write form auth http module.

* Think about packet trace. Obviously without pcap or something similar,
  we can only print info about TCP payloads or connection
  initiations/endings. How can I get the unique connection id from nsock?

* Search for good username and password lists, or find ways to
  generate them (e.g. web scraping for email addresses or account
  names or whatever). Usernames seems like a relatively easy problem,
  while password lists are more difficult to come by.
  * Assembled a lot of lists. Now need to sort them out.

* Add --resume support

* Test more thoroughly the windows version of ncrack.

* Complete output engine. The main thing left is support for XML output using
  the option -oX.

* Solve the ssh username/password special iteration challenge as mentioned here:
  http://seclists.org/nmap-dev/2009/q3/0119.html

* Await reply from Microsoft for Windows Firewall RFC deviation:

  ------> It seems the Microsoft guys found the thing not reproducible but they
  must have tested it under XP SP2 whereas the behaviour seems to be occuring
  only in SP3. I have mentioned that in a comment but they probably won't see
  that again, so perhaps I might have to resubmit the issue. 
  ------> I have resubmitted the bug, pointing out now that it only applies
  to XP SP3:

* We may also need to increase the maximum number of half-open connections in
  Windows: see http://half-open.com/home_en.htm - We could do this by asking the
  user during Ncrack setup if he wants to update the system's imposed limit - if
  he doesn't want to accept the change, then he will possibly suffer a
  performance degradation.

* Add IPv6 support
  
* Handle the case where ftp tells us that it accepts anonymous login only so
  that we don't waste time cracking it.

* If a connection times out continuously for 1 service and the rest of the
  services need to poll for new events through nsock_loop, the fact that
  ncrack_connection_end calls ncrack_probes again won't let that happen
  So for many errors of 1 connection perhaps just toss service into a special
  list so that we can move on for the time being.

* Complete dynamic timing engine.

* For -vv verbose mode, possibly save the banner for each service and show it at
  the end. Also we can show a sample session, showing the special patterns used
  in the authentication steps. These may also prove useful for user submissions
  of new exotic patterns for modules, like telnet, that need them.


============================== DONE ==========================================

* Possibly adapt Nmap license headers to Ncrack specifically.
  --> This has been halted for a while, until a unified solution for all
  Nmap tools is found.

* Documentation: write the man page (in Docbook XML, at least for the
  final version)

* Test buffering cases for all modules, when for example we need to search for
  certain patterns but the pattern is split in 2 separate packets due to a
  small window.
  ---> SSH already does that by using the ssh_loop_read function and I have
  already added the Buf class (derived from buffer.c of OpenSSH) that can be
  used to append the replies from each protocol. Now I only need to adapt the
  FTP and TELNET modules to use that instead of the con->buf thing.
  All modules have now been replaced to use the Buf class.

* On a brand-new checkout, configure seems to be running 2 times for the
  libraries nbase and nsock - one time in the beginning of calling ./configure
  and a second time after typing make. Why does this happen? In addition, there
  seems to be a problem when changing the order of linking - if nbase comes
  first and nsock comes second, linking problems between the two arise. However,
  nmap has them in that order without any problems.
  This problem seems to have been automagically solved.

* For future reference on modules like http: consider saving state information
  like the http parsing that needs to be done only 1 time per host inside the
  service, so that future connections can refer to that instead of having to
  redo that work. That will probably add to the speed.
  State information is already used by nearly all modules.

* Make Ncrack packaging - a source tarball for *nix and a Windows installer.

* Fix the false positives/false negative issues we've been seeing
  when scanning over the Internet for http module.

* Add ssl support (through nsock).

* Implement Service timeout, where the user imposes a certain timeout
  after which the service is marked as finished regardless of the progress
  so far.

* Refine interactive Status Report to print an estimate of the time left.

* Change Ncrack's build system so that whenever ssl isn't found on the system,
  the ssh module isn't included/compiled, since it requires (the underlying
  opensshlib actually does) it in order to work.

* Add output info when Ncrack finishes, the way Nmap does it.
  Also -v should print additional info like how many connections were
  initiated etc 
  Example from Nmap:
    (verbose)
    Nmap done: 1 IP address (1 host up) scanned in 0.26 seconds
    Raw packets sent: 1000 (44.000KB) | Rcvd: 2010 (84.440KB)
    (normal)
    Nmap done: 1 IP address (1 host up) scanned in 0.27 seconds

* Refine core engine. 

* Code ssh module

* Test telnet module, thoroughly

* Port Ncrack to Windows

* Complete ncrack callback handlers documentation.

* Appended Nmap license headers to each ncrack file.

* Handle case when connection limit is more than the total passwords/usernames
  in list

* Implement on-the-fly 'Status Report' within interactive Ncrack output.

* Code output.cc and -oN option.

* Implement interactive Ncrack output.

* Implement queueing mechanism for ServiceGroup lists.

* Studied SSH RFCs.
