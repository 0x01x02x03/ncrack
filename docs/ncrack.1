.PP
Ncrack is an open source tool for network authentication cracking\&. It was designed for high\-speed parallel cracking using a dynamic engine that can adapt to different network situations\&. Ncrack can also be extensively fine\-tuned for special cases, though the default parameters are generic enough to cover almost every situation\&. It is built on a modular architecture that allows for easy extension to support additional protocols\&. While Ncrack\'s main purpose is to audit the security of large networks for default, weak passwords in a rapid, yet reliable way, it can also be used to conduct some fairly sophisticated bruteforcing attacks\&.
.PP
The output from Ncrack is a list of found credentials, if any, for each of the targets specified\&. Ncrack can also print an interactive status report of progress so far and possibly additional debugging information that can help track problems, if the user selected that option\&.
.PP
A typical Ncrack scan is shown in
Example\ \&1\&. The only Ncrack arguments used in this example are the two target IP addresses along with the the corresponding ports for each of them\&. The two example ports 21 and 22 are automatically resolved to the default services listening on them: ftp and ssh\&.

.SH "TARGET SPECIFICATION"
.\" target specification
.PP
Everything on the Ncrack command\-line that isn\'t an option (or an option argument) is treated as a target host specification\&. The simplest case is to specify a target IP address or a hostname\&.
.PP
Sometimes you wish to crack a whole network of adjacent hosts\&. For this, Ncrack supports CIDR\-style
.\" CIDR (Classless Inter-Domain Routing)
addressing\&. You can append /\fInumbits\fR
to an IPv4 address or hostname and Ncrack will try to crack every IP address for which the first numbits are the same as for the reference IP or hostname given\&. For example, 192\&.168\&.10\&.0/24 would send probes to the 256 hosts between 192\&.168\&.10\&.0
11000000 10101000 00001010 00000000) and 192\&.168\&.10\&.255 (binary:
11000000 10101000 00001010 11111111), inclusive\&. 192\&.168\&.10\&.40/24 would crack exactly the same targets\&. Given that the host
scanme\&.nmap\&.org
.\" scanme.nmap.org
is at the IP address 64\&.13\&.134\&.52, the specification scanme\&.nmap\&.org/16 would send probes to the 65,536 IP addresses between 64\&.13\&.0\&.0 and 64\&.13\&.255\&.255\&. The smallest allowed value is /0, which targets the whole Internet\&. The largest value is /32, which targets just the named host or IP address because all address bits are fixed\&.
.\" address ranges
.PP
CIDR notation is short but not always flexible enough\&. For example, you might want to send probes to 192\&.168\&.0\&.0/16 but skip any IPs ending with \&.0 or \&.255 because they may be used as subnet network and broadcast addresses\&. Ncrack supports this through octet range addressing\&. Rather than specify a normal IP address, you can specify a comma\-separated list of numbers or ranges for each octet\&. For example, 192\&.168\&.0\-255\&.1\-254 will skip all addresses in the range that end in \&.0 or \&.255, and 192\&.168\&.3\-5,7\&.1 will target the four addresses 192\&.168\&.3\&.1, 192\&.168\&.4\&.1, 192\&.168\&.5\&.1, and 192\&.168\&.7\&.1\&. Either side of a range may be omitted; the default values are 0 on the left and 255 on the right\&. Using
\-
by itself is the same as 0\-255, but remember to use 0\- in the first octet so the target specification doesn\'t look like a command\-line option\&. Ranges need not be limited to the final octets: the specifier will send probes to all IP addresses on the Internet ending in 13\&.37 This sort of broad sampling can be useful for Internet surveys and research\&.
.PP
Ncrack accepts multiple host specifications on the command line, and they don\'t need to be the same type\&. The command
\fBncrack scanme\&.nmap\&.org 192\&.168\&.0\&.0/8 10\&.0\&.0,1,3\-7\&.\- \-p22\fR
does what you would expect\&.
.PP
While targets are usually specified on the command lines, the following options are also available to control target selection:
.PP
\fB\-iL \fR\fB\fIinputfilename\fR\fR (Input from list) .\" -iL .\" target specification: from list
.RS 4
Reads target specifications from
\fIinputfilename\fR\&. Passing a huge list of hosts is often awkward on the command line, yet it is a common desire\&. For example, you might want to crack a list of very specific servers that have been specified for penetration testing\&. Simply generate the list of hosts to crack and pass that filename to Ncrack as an argument to the
\fB\-iL\fR
option\&. Entries can be in any of the formats accepted by Ncrack on the command line (IP address, hostname, CIDR, octet ranges or Ncrack\'s special host\-service syntax\&. Each entry must be separated by one or more spaces, tabs, or newlines\&. You can specify a hyphen (\-) as the filename if you want Ncrack to read hosts from standard input rather than an actual file\&. Note, however, that if hosts are specified without any service, you will have to also provide services/ports for the targets using the
\fB\-p\fR
option\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-exclude \fR\fB\fIhost1\fR\fR\fB[, \fIhost2\fR[, \&.\&.\&.]]\fR (Exclude hosts/networks) .\" --exclude .\" excluding targets
.RS 4
Specifies a comma\-separated list of targets to be excluded from the scan even if they are part of the overall network range you specify\&. The list you pass in uses normal Ncrack syntax, so it can include hostnames, CIDR netblocks, octet ranges, etc\&. This can be useful when the network you wish to scan includes untouchable mission\-critical servers, systems that are known to react adversely to heavy load, or subnets administered by other people\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-excludefile \fR\fB\fIexclude_file\fR\fR\fB \fR (Exclude list from file) .\" --excludefile
.RS 4
This offers the same functionality as the
\fB\-\-exclude\fR
option, except that the excluded targets are provided in a newline, space, or tab delimited
\fIexclude_file\fR
rather than on the command line\&.
.RE
.SH "MISCELLANEOUS OPTIONS"
.PP
This section describes some important (and not\-so\-important) options that don\'t really fit anywhere else\&.
.PP
\fB\-\-datadir \fR\fB\fIdirectoryname\fR\fR (Specify custom Ncrack data file location) .\" --datadir
.RS 4
Ncrack needs a file called
ncrack\-services
to load a lookup\-table of supported services/ports\&. This file shouldn\'t be changed, unless you know what you are doing (e\&.g extending Ncrack for additional modules)\&. In addition, Ncrack is shipped with various username and password lists, some of which are used by default in case the user doesn\'t specify ones of his own\&. All these files are normally copied during the installation procedure to a directory such as /usr/share/ncrack or /usr/local/share/ncrack \&. Using the
\fB\-\-datadir\fR
option, will force Ncrack to start searching for these files in specified directory\&. If the files aren\'t found, then it will continue searching in the directory specified by the NCRACKDIR environmental variable
\fBNCRACKDIR\fR
(if it is defined)\&. Next comes
~/\&.ncrack
directory for real and effective UIDs (POSIX systems only) or location of the Ncrack executable (Win32 only), and then a compiled\-in location such as
/usr/local/share/ncrack
or
/usr/share/ncrack\&. As a last resort, Ncrack will look in the current directory\&.
.RE

.RE
.SH "RUNTIME INTERACTION"
.PP
During the execution of Ncrack, all key presses are captured\&. This allows you to interact with the program without aborting and restarting it\&. Certain special keys will change options, while any other keys will print out a status message telling you about the scan\&. The convention is that
\fIlowercase letters increase\fR
the amount of printing, and
\fIuppercase letters decrease\fR
the printing\&. You may also press \(oq\fI?\fR\(cq for help\&.
