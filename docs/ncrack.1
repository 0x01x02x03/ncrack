.PP
Ncrack is an open source tool for network authentication cracking\&. It was designed for high\-speed parallel cracking using a dynamic engine that can adapt to different network situations\&. Ncrack can also be extensively fine\-tuned for special cases, though the default parameters are generic enough to cover almost every situation\&. It is built on a modular architecture that allows for easy extension to support additional protocols\&. While Ncrack\'s main purpose is to audit the security of large networks for default, weak passwords in a rapid, yet reliable way, it can also be used to conduct some fairly sophisticated bruteforcing attacks\&.
.PP
The output from Ncrack is a list of found credentials, if any, for each of the targets specified\&. Ncrack can also print an interactive status report of progress so far and possibly additional debugging information that can help track problems, if the user selected that option\&.
.PP
A typical Ncrack scan is shown in
Example\ \&1\&. The only Ncrack arguments used in this example are the two target IP addresses along with the the corresponding ports for each of them\&. The two example ports 21 and 22 are automatically resolved to the default services listening on them: ftp and ssh\&.

.SH "TARGET SPECIFICATION"
.\" target specification
.PP
Everything on the Ncrack command\-line that isn\'t an option (or an option argument) is treated as a target host specification\&. The simplest case is to specify a target IP address or a hostname\&. Note, that you also need to specify a service to crack for the selected targets\&. Ncrack is very flexible in host/service specification\&. While hostnames and IP addresses can be defined with the flexibility that you are probably used to from Nmap, services along with service\-specific options have a unique specification style that enables a combination of features to be taken advantage of\&.
.PP
Sometimes you wish to crack a whole network of adjacent hosts\&. For this, Ncrack supports CIDR\-style
.\" CIDR (Classless Inter-Domain Routing)
addressing\&. You can append /\fInumbits\fR
to an IPv4 address or hostname and Ncrack will try to crack every IP address for which the first numbits are the same as for the reference IP or hostname given\&. For example, 192\&.168\&.10\&.0/24 would send probes to the 256 hosts between 192\&.168\&.10\&.0
11000000 10101000 00001010 00000000) and 192\&.168\&.10\&.255 (binary:
11000000 10101000 00001010 11111111), inclusive\&. 192\&.168\&.10\&.40/24 would crack exactly the same targets\&. Given that the host
scanme\&.nmap\&.org
.\" scanme.nmap.org
is at the IP address 64\&.13\&.134\&.52, the specification scanme\&.nmap\&.org/16 would send probes to the 65,536 IP addresses between 64\&.13\&.0\&.0 and 64\&.13\&.255\&.255\&. The smallest allowed value is /0, which targets the whole Internet\&. The largest value is /32, which targets just the named host or IP address because all address bits are fixed\&.
.\" address ranges
.PP
CIDR notation is short but not always flexible enough\&. For example, you might want to send probes to 192\&.168\&.0\&.0/16 but skip any IPs ending with \&.0 or \&.255 because they may be used as subnet network and broadcast addresses\&. Ncrack supports this through octet range addressing\&. Rather than specify a normal IP address, you can specify a comma\-separated list of numbers or ranges for each octet\&. For example, 192\&.168\&.0\-255\&.1\-254 will skip all addresses in the range that end in \&.0 or \&.255, and 192\&.168\&.3\-5,7\&.1 will target the four addresses 192\&.168\&.3\&.1, 192\&.168\&.4\&.1, 192\&.168\&.5\&.1, and 192\&.168\&.7\&.1\&. Either side of a range may be omitted; the default values are 0 on the left and 255 on the right\&. Using
\-
by itself is the same as 0\-255, but remember to use 0\- in the first octet so the target specification doesn\'t look like a command\-line option\&. Ranges need not be limited to the final octets: the specifier will send probes to all IP addresses on the Internet ending in 13\&.37 This sort of broad sampling can be useful for Internet surveys and research\&.
.PP
Ncrack accepts multiple host specifications on the command line, and they don\'t need to be the same type\&. The command
\fBncrack scanme\&.nmap\&.org 192\&.168\&.0\&.0/8 10\&.0\&.0,1,3\-7\&.\- \-p22\fR
does what you would expect\&.
.PP
While targets are usually specified on the command lines, the following options are also available to control target selection:
.PP
\fB\-iL \fR\fB\fIinputfilename\fR\fR (Input from list) .\" -iL .\" target specification: from list
.RS 4
Reads target specifications from
\fIinputfilename\fR\&. Passing a huge list of hosts is often awkward on the command line, yet it is a common desire\&. For example, you might want to crack a list of very specific servers that have been specified for penetration testing\&. Simply generate the list of hosts to crack and pass that filename to Ncrack as an argument to the
\fB\-iL\fR
option\&. Entries can be in any of the formats accepted by Ncrack on the command line (IP address, hostname, CIDR, octet ranges or Ncrack\'s special host\-service syntax\&. Each entry must be separated by one or more spaces, tabs, or newlines\&. You can specify a hyphen (\-) as the filename if you want Ncrack to read hosts from standard input rather than an actual file\&. Note, however, that if hosts are specified without any service, you will have to also provide services/ports for the targets using the
\fB\-p\fR
option\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-exclude \fR\fB\fIhost1\fR\fR\fB[, \fIhost2\fR[, \&.\&.\&.]]\fR (Exclude hosts/networks) .\" --exclude .\" excluding targets
.RS 4
Specifies a comma\-separated list of targets to be excluded from the scan even if they are part of the overall network range you specify\&. The list you pass in uses normal Ncrack syntax, so it can include hostnames, CIDR netblocks, octet ranges, etc\&. This can be useful when the network you wish to scan includes untouchable mission\-critical servers, systems that are known to react adversely to heavy load, or subnets administered by other people\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-excludefile \fR\fB\fIexclude_file\fR\fR\fB \fR (Exclude list from file) .\" --excludefile

This offers the same functionality as the
\fB\-\-exclude\fR
option, except that the excluded targets are provided in a newline, space, or tab delimited
\fIexclude_file\fR
rather than on the command line\&.
.RE
.SH "SERVICE SPECIFICATION"
.\" service specification
.PP
No cracking session can be carried out without targetting a certain service to attack\&. Service specification is one of the most flexible subsystems of Ncrack and collaborates with target\-specification in a way that allows different option combinations to be applied\&. For Ncrack to start running, you will have to specify at least one target host and one associated service to attack\&. Ncrack provides ways to specify a service by its default port number, by its name (as extracted from the
ncrack\-services
file) or both\&. Normally, you need to define both name and port number only in the special case where you know that a particular service is listening on a non\-default port\&.
.PP
Ncrack offers two distinct ways with which services will be applied to your targets: per\-host service specification and global specification\&.
.PP
\fBPer\-host service specification\fR
.PP
.RS 4
Services specified in this mode are written next to the host and apply to it only\&. Keep in mind, however, that target\-specification allows wildcards/netmasks, which essentially means that applying a per\-host service specification format to that particular target will affect all of the expanded ones as a result\&. The general format is:
.sp
\fB \fR\fB\fI[service\-name]\fR\fR\fB://\fR\fB\fItarget\fR\fR\fB:\fR\fB\fI[port\-number]\fR\fR
.sp
where
\fItarget\fR
is a hostname or IP address in any of the formats described in the target\-specification section,
\fI[service\-name]\fR
is one of the common service names as defined in the
\fIncrack\-services\fR
file (e\&.g ssh, http) and
\fI[port\-number]\fR
is what it obviously means\&. Ncrack can determine the default port numbers for each of the services it supports, as well as being able to deduce the service name when a default port number has been specified\&. Specifying both has meaning only when the user has a priori knowledge of a service listening on a non\-default port number\&. This can easily be determined by using version detection like the one offered by Nmap\'s
\fB\-sV\fR
option\&.
.PP

.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}

The above command will try to crack hosts: scanme\&.nmap\&.org on SSH service (default port 22), 10\&.0\&.0\&.10 on FTP service (default port 21) and 192\&.168\&.1\&.0 \- 192\&.168\&.1\&.255 (all of this C subnet) on SSH service on non\-default port 5910 which has been explicitly specified\&. In the last case, Ncrack wouldn\'t be able to determine that the subnet hosts are to be scanned against the SSH service on that particular port without the user explicitly asking for it, because there isn\'t any mapping of port\-number 5910 to service SSH\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBGlobal service specification\fR
.PP
.RS 4
Services specified in this mode are applied to
\fIall\fR
hosts that haven\'t been associated with the per\-host service specification format\&. This is done using the
\fB\-p\fR
option\&. While this facility may be similar to that of Nmap\'s, you should try not to confuse it, since the functionality is of a slightly different nature\&. Services can be specified using comma separated directives of the general format:
.sp
\fB \-p \fR\fB\fI[service1]\fR\fR\fB:\fR\fB\fI[port\-number1]\fR\fR\fB,\fR\fB\fI[service2]\fR\fR\fB:\fR\fB\fI[port\-number2]\fR\fR\fB,\&.\&.\&. \fR
.sp
As usual, you need not specify both service name and port number since Ncrack knows the mappings of default\-services to default\-port numbers\&. Be careful though not to include any space between each service\-name and/or port number, because Ncrack will think that the argument after the space is a host as per the rule "everything that isn\'t an option is a target specification"\&.

.RE
.PP
Of course, Ncrack allows you to combine both modes of service specification if you deem that as necessary\&. Normally, you will only need to specify a couple of services but cracking a lot of hosts against many different services might be a longterm project for large networks that need to be consistently audited for weak passwords\&. If you are in doubt, about which hosts and services are going to be cracked with the current command, you can use the
\fB\-sL\fR
option (see below for explanation)\&.
.SH "SERVICE OPTIONS"
.\" service options
.PP
Apart from general service specification, Ncrack allows you to provide a multitude of options that apply to each or a subset of your targets\&. Options include timing and performance optimizations (which are thoroughly analyzed in a seperate section), SSL enabling/disabling and other module\-specific parameters like the relative URL path for the HTTP module\&. Options can be defined in a variety of ways which include: per\-host options, per\-module options and global options\&. Since a combination of these options may be used, there is a strict hierarchy of precedence which will be discussed later\&.
.PP
\fBPer\-host Options\fR
.PP
.RS 4
Options in this mode apply only to the host(s) they are referring to and are written next to it according to the following format:
.sp
\fB \fR\fB\fI[service\-name]\fR\fR\fB://\fR\fB\fItarget\fR\fR\fB:\fR\fB\fI[port\-number]\fR\fR\fB,\fR\fB\fIopt1\fR\fR\fB=\fR\fB\fIoptval1\fR\fR\fB,\fR\fB\fIopt2\fR\fR\fB=\fR\fB\fIoptval\fR\fR\fB,\&.\&.\&. \fR
.sp
The format concerning the service specification which comes before the options, has been explained in the previous section\&.
\fB\fIoptN\fR\fR
is referring to any of the option names that are available (a list will follow below), while
\fBoptvalN\fR
determines the value of that option and depends on the nature of it\&. For example, most timing\-related options expect to receive numbers as values, while the
\fBpath\fR
option obviously needs a string argument\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBPer\-module Options\fR
.PP
.RS 4
Options in this mode apply to all hosts that are associated with the particular service/module\&. This is accomplished using the
\fB\-m\fR
which is defined with the format:
.sp
\fB \-m \fR\fB\fIservice\-name\fR\fR\fB:\fR\fB\fIopt1\fR\fR\fB=\fR\fB\fIoptval1\fR\fR\fB,\fR\fB\fIopt2\fR\fR\fB=\fR\fB\fIoptval2\fR\fR\fB,\&.\&.\&. \fR
.sp
This option can be invoked multiple times, for as many different services as you might need to define service\-wide applicable options\&. Each iteration of this option must refer to only one service\&. However, to avoid confusion, this option had better not be called more than one time for the same service, although this is allowed and the last iteration will take precedence over the previous ones for all redefined option values\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBGlobal Options\fR
.PP
.RS 4
Options in this mode apply to all hosts regardless of which service they are associated with\&. This is accomplished using the
\fB\-g\fR
as follows:
.sp
\fB \-g \fR\fB\fIopt1\fR\fR\fB=\fR\fB\fIoptval1\fR\fR\fB,\fR\fB\fIopt2\fR\fR\fB=\fR\fB\fIoptval2\fR\fR\fB,\&.\&.\&. \fR
.sp
This acts as a convenience option, where you can apply options to all services globally\&. Everything else regarding the available options and option values is the same as the previous modes\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBList of available Service Options\fR

\fBssl\fR (Enable/Disable SSL over service)
.RS 4
By enabling SSL, Ncrack will try to open a TCP connection and then negotiate a SSL session with the target\&. Everything will then be transparently encrypted and decrypted\&. However, since Ncrack\'s job is to provide speed rather than strong crypto, the algorithms and ciphers for SSL are chosen on an efficiency basis\&. Possible values for this option are \'\fByes\fR\' but just specifying
\fBssl\fR
would be enough\&. Thus, this is the only option that doesn\'t need to be written in the
\fIopt\fR=\fIoptval\fR
format\&. By default, SSL is disabled for all services except those that are stricly dependent on it like HTTPS\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBpath <name>\fR (Path name for relative URLs)
.RS 4
Some services like HTTP or SVN usually require a specific path in the URL\&. This option takes that pathname string as its value\&. The path is always relative to the hostname or IP address, so if you want to target something like http://foobar\&.com/login\&.php the path must take the value
\fBpath=login\&.php\fR
\&. The first \'/\' is added if you omit it, but you will have to explicitly specify it at the end of pathnames that are directories\&. So cracking the directory for http://foobar\&.com/protected\-dir/ would require
\fBpath=protected\-dir/\fR
\&. Since the symbol \'=\' is used by Ncrack for argument parsing, you will have to espace it if it is included in the URL\&. By default, the path\-name is initialized to \'/\', but will be ignored by services that do not require it\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBService Option Hierarchy\fR
.PP
As already noted, Ncrack allows a combination of the three different modes of service option specification\&. In that case, there is a strict hierarchy that resolves the order in which conflicting values for these options take precedence over each other\&. The order is as follows, leftmost being the highest priority and rightmost the lowest one:
.PP
Per\-host options > Per\-module options > Global options > Timing\-Template (for timing options only)
.PP
The concept of the "Timing\-Template" will be explained in the Section "Timing and Performance", but for now, just have in mind that its values have the least prevalence over everything else and essentially act as defaults for everything timing\-related\&. Global options specified with
\fB\-g\fR
have the directly higher precedence, while
\fB\-m\fR
per\-module options are immediately higher\&. In the top of the hierarcy reside the per\-host options which are essentially the most specific ones\&. Consequently, you can see that the pattern is: the more specific the higher the precedence\&.

.fi
.if n \{\

.PP
The example demonstrates the hierarchy precedence\&. The services that are going to be cracked are SSH for scanme\&.nmap\&.org and FTP for hosts 10\&.0\&.0\&.120, 10\&.0\&.0\&.20\&. No particular timing\-template has been specified and thus the default will be used (Normal \- 3)\&. The per\-host options for scanme\&.nmap\&.org define that the minimum connection limit (cl) is 10 and that Ncrack should attempt only 1 authentication try (at) per connection\&. These values would override any other for service SSH of host scanme\&.nmap\&.org if there were conflicts with other modes\&. Since a global option of
\fB\-g CL=3\fR
was defined and there is no other higher\-precedence for service SSH and scanme\&.nmap\&.org in particular, this value will also be applied\&. As for the FTP targets, the per\-module
\fB\-m ftp:CL=1\fR
defined for all FTP services will override the equivalent global one\&. All these can get quite complex if overused, but they are not expected to be leveraged by the average Ncrack user anyway\&. Complicated network scanning scenarios might require them, though\&. To make certain the results are the ones you expect them to be, don\'t forget to use the
\fB\-sL\fR
option that prints out details about what Ncrack would crack if invoked normally\&. You can add the debugging
\fB\-d\fR
option if you want even more verbose output\&. For the above example, Ncrack would print the following:

The

just lists the per\-module options for all available services\&. As you can see, the only defined option is in the FTP service for the
\fBCL\fR
\&. The
\fITargets\fR
table is the most important part of this output and lists all targets and associated options according to the command\-line invokation\&. No network operation takes place in this mode, apart from forward DNS resolution for hostnames (like scanme\&.nmap\&.org in this example)\&.
.SH "TIMING AND PERFORMANCE"
.\" timing
.\" performance
.PP
The timing engine is perhaps the most important part of any serious network authentication cracking tool\&. Ncrack\'s timing engine offers a great many options for optimization and can be bended to serve virtually any user need\&. As Ncrack is progressing, this subsystem is going to evolve into a dynamic autonomous engine that will be able to automatically adjust its behaviour according to the network feedback it gets, in order to achieve maximum performance and precision without any user intervention\&.
.PP
Some options accept a
time
parameter\&. This is specified in milliseconds by default, though you can append \(oqs\(cq, \(oqm\(cq, or \(oqh\(cq to the value to specify seconds, minutes, or hours\&. So the
\fBcd\fR
(connection delay) arguments
900000,
900s, and
15m
all do the same thing\&.

\fBConnection Limit\fR
.sp
These options control the total number of connections that may be outstanding for any service at the same time\&. Normally, Ncrack tries to dynamically adjust the number of connections for each individual target by counting how many drops or connection failures happen\&. If a strange network condition occurs, that signifies that something may be going wrong, like the host dropping any new connection attempts, then Ncrack will immediately lower the parallel connections hitting the service\&. However, the caps number of the minimum or maximum connections that will take place can be overriden using these two options\&. By properly adjusting these options you can essentially optimize performance, if you can handle the tricky part of knowing or discovering your target\'s own limits\&. The convention here is that
\fBcl\fR
with lowercase letters is referring to the minimum connection limit, while
\fBCL \fR
with uppercase letters is referring to the maximum connections\&.
.sp
The most common usage is to set
\fBcl (minimum connection limit)\fR
for targets that you are almost certain are going to withstand these many connections at any given time\&. This is a risky option to play with, as setting it too high might actually do more harm than good by effectively DoS\-attacking the target and triggering firewall rules that will ban your IP address\&.
.sp
On the other hand, for more stealthy missions, setting the
\fBCL (maximum connection limit)\fR
to a low value might be what you want\&. However, setting it too low will surely have a great impact in overall cracking speed\&. For maximum stealth, this can be combined with the
\fBcd (connection delay)\fR
described below\&.

.SH "OUTPUT"
.\" output formats
.PP
Any security tool is only as useful as the output it generates\&. Complex tests and algorithms are of little value if they aren\'t presented in an organized and comprehensible fashion\&. Of course, no single format can please everyone\&. So Ncrack offers several formats, including the interactive mode for humans to read directly and XML for easy parsing by software\&.
.PP
In addition to offering different output formats, Ncrack provides options for controlling the verbosity of output as well as debugging messages\&. Output types may be sent to standard output or to named files, which Ncrack can append to or clobber\&.
.PP
Ncrack makes output available in three different formats\&. The default is called
interactive output, and it is sent to standard output (stdout)\&. There is also
normal output, which is similar to interactive except that it displays less runtime information and warnings since it is expected to be analyzed after the scan completes rather than interactively\&.
.PP
XML output
is one of the most important output types, as it can be converted to HTML, easily parsed by programs such as Ncrack graphical user interfaces, or imported into databases\&. Currently, XML output hasn\'t been implemented\&.
.PP
While interactive output is the default and has no associated command\-line options, the other two format options use the same syntax\&. They take one argument, which is the filename that results should be stored in\&. Multiple formats may be specified, but each format may only be specified once\&. For example, you may wish to save normal output for your own review while saving XML of the same scan for programmatic analysis\&. You might do this with the options
\fB\-oX myscan\&.xml \-oN myscan\&.ncrack\fR\&. While this chapter uses the simple names like
myscan\&.xml
for brevity, more descriptive names are generally recommended\&. The names chosen are a matter of personal preference\&. A scheme could be using long filenames that incorporate the scan date and a word or two describing the scan, placed in a directory named after the company that is being scanned\&.
.PP
While these options save results to files, Ncrack still prints interactive output to stdout as usual\&. For example, the command
\fBnmap \-oX myscan\&.xml [target]\fR
prints XML to
myscan\&.xml
and fills standard output with the same interactive results it would have printed if
\fB\-oX\fR
wasn\'t specified at all\&. You can change this by passing a hyphen character as the argument to one of the format types\&. This causes Ncrack to deactivate interactive output, and instead print results in the format you specified to the standard output stream\&. So the command
\fBnmap \-oX \- target\fR
will send only XML output to stdout\&. Serious errors may still be printed to the normal error stream, stderr\&.
.PP
Unlike some Ncrack arguments, the space between the logfile option flag (such as
\fB\-oX\fR) and the filename or hyphen is mandatory\&.
.PP
All of these arguments support
\fBstrftime\fR\-like conversions in the filename\&.
%H,
%M,
%S,
%m,
%d,
%y, and
%Y
are all exactly the same as in
\fBstrftime\fR\&.
%T
is the same as
%H%M%S,
%R
is the same as
%H%M, and
%D
is the same as
%m%d%y\&. A
%
followed by any other character just yields that character (%%
gives you a percent symbol)\&. So
\fB\-oX \'scan\-%T\-%D\&.xml\'\fR
will use an XML file in the form of
scan\-144840\-121307\&.xml\&.
.PP
Ncrack also offers options to control scan verbosity and to append to output files rather than clobbering them\&. All of these options are described below\&.

Increases the verbosity level, causing Ncrack to print more information about the scan in progress\&. Credentials are shown as they are found and more statistical information is printed in the end\&. Use it twice or more for even greater verbosity\&.
.\" -v: giving more than once
.RE
.PP
\fB\-d [level]\fR (Increase or set debugging level) .\" -d .\" debugging
.RS 4
When even verbose mode doesn\'t provide sufficient data for you, debugging is available to flood you with much more! As with the verbosity option (\fB\-v\fR), debugging is enabled with a command\-line flag (\fB\-d\fR) and the debug level can be increased by specifying it multiple times\&. Alternatively, you can set a debug level by giving an argument to
\fB\-d\fR\&. For example,
\fB\-d10\fR
sets level ten\&. That is the highest effective level and will produce thousands of lines, unless your cracking session is going really slow\&.
.sp
Debugging output is useful when a bug is suspected in Ncrack, or if you are simply confused as to what Ncrack is doing and why\&. As this feature is mostly intended for developers, debug lines aren\'t always self\-explanatory\&. If you don\'t understand a line, your only recourses are to ignore it, look it up in the source code, or request help from the development list (nmap\-dev)\&. Some lines are self explanatory, but the messages become more obscure as the debug level is increased\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-log\-errors\fR (Log errors/warnings to normal mode output file) .\" --log-errors
.RS 4
Warnings and errors printed by Ncrack usually go only to the screen (interactive output), leaving any normal\-format output files (usually specified with
\fB\-oN\fR) uncluttered\&. When you do want to see those messages in the normal output file you specified, add this option\&. It is useful when you aren\'t watching the interactive output or when you want to record errors while debugging a problem\&. The error and warning messages will still appear in interactive mode too\&. This won\'t work for most errors related to bad command\-line arguments because Ncrack may not have initialized its output files yet\&.
.sp
An alternative to
\fB\-\-log\-errors\fR
is redirecting interactive output (including the standard error stream) to a file\&. Most Unix shells make this approach easy, though it can be difficult on Windows\&.

\fB\-\-append\-output\fR
option\&. All output filenames specified in that Ncrack execution will then be appended to rather than clobbered\&. This doesn\'t work well for XML (\fB\-oX\fR) scan data as the resultant file generally won\'t parse properly until you fix it up by hand\&.

.PP
\fB\-\-datadir \fR\fB\fIdirectoryname\fR\fR (Specify custom Ncrack data file location) .\" --datadir
.RS 4
Ncrack needs a file called
ncrack\-services
to load a lookup\-table of supported services/ports\&. This file shouldn\'t be changed, unless you know what you are doing (e\&.g extending Ncrack for additional modules)\&. In addition, Ncrack is shipped with various username and password lists, some of which are used by default in case the user doesn\'t specify ones of his own\&. All these files are normally copied during the installation procedure to a directory such as /usr/share/ncrack or /usr/local/share/ncrack \&. Using the
\fB\-\-datadir\fR
option, will force Ncrack to start searching for these files in specified directory\&. If the files aren\'t found, then it will continue searching in the directory specified by the NCRACKDIR environmental variable
\fBNCRACKDIR\fR
(if it is defined)\&. Next comes
~/\&.ncrack
directory for real and effective UIDs (POSIX systems only) or location of the Ncrack executable (Win32 only), and then a compiled\-in location such as
/usr/local/share/ncrack
