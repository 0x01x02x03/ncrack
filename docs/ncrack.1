.PP
Ncrack is an open source tool for network authentication cracking\&. It was designed for high\-speed parallel cracking using a dynamic engine that can adapt to different network situations\&. Ncrack can also be extensively fine\-tuned for special cases, though the default parameters are generic enough to cover almost every situation\&. It is built on a modular architecture that allows for easy extension to support additional protocols\&. While Ncrack\'s main purpose is to audit the security of large networks for default, weak passwords in a rapid, yet reliable way, it can also be used to conduct some fairly sophisticated bruteforcing attacks\&.
.PP
The output from Ncrack is a list of found credentials, if any, for each of the targets specified\&. Ncrack can also print an interactive status report of progress so far and possibly additional debugging information that can help track problems, if the user selected that option\&.
.PP
A typical Ncrack scan is shown in
Example\ \&1\&. The only Ncrack arguments used in this example are the two target IP addresses along with the the corresponding ports for each of them\&. The two example ports 21 and 22 are automatically resolved to the default services listening on them: ftp and ssh\&.

  (seconds), \'m\' (minutes), or \'h\' (hours) to the value (e\&.g\&. 30m)\&.
  Service\-specific options:
    cl (min connection limit): minimum number of concurrent parallel connections
    CL (max connection limit): maximum number of concurrent parallel connections
    at (authentication tries): authentication attempts per connection
    cd (connection delay): delay between each connection initiation (in milliseconds)
    cr (connection retries): caps number of service connection attempts
  \-T<0\-5>: Set timing template (higher is faster)
  \-\-connection\-limit <number>: threshold for total concurrent connections
AUTHENTICATION:
  \-U <filename>: username file
  \-P <filename>: password file
  \-\-passwords\-first: Iterate password list for each username\&. Default is opposite\&.
OUTPUT:
  \-oN/\-oX <file>: Output scan in normal and XML format,
  respectively, to the given filename\&.
  \-oA <basename>: Output in the three major formats at once
  \-v: Increase verbosity level (use twice or more for greater effect)
  \-d[level]: Set or increase debugging level (Up to 10 is meaningful)
  \-\-log\-errors: Log errors/warnings to the normal\-format output file
  \-\-append\-output: Append to rather than clobber specified output files
MISC:
  \-sL or \-\-list: only list hosts and services
  \-V: Print version number
  \-h: Print this help summary page\&.

.SH "TARGET SPECIFICATION"
.\" target specification
.PP
Everything on the Ncrack command\-line that isn\'t an option (or an option argument) is treated as a target host specification\&. The simplest case is to specify a target IP address or a hostname\&.
.PP
Sometimes you wish to ping a whole network of adjacent hosts\&. For this, Ncrack supports CIDR\-style
.\" CIDR (Classless Inter-Domain Routing)
addressing\&. You can append /\fInumbits\fR
to an IPv4 address or hostname and Ncrack will send probes to every IP address for which the first numbits are the same as for the reference IP or hostname given\&. For example, 192\&.168\&.10\&.0/24 would send probes to the 256 hosts between 192\&.168\&.10\&.0
11000000 10101000 00001010 00000000) and 192\&.168\&.10\&.255 (binary:
11000000 10101000 00001010 11111111), inclusive\&. 192\&.168\&.10\&.40/24 would ping exactly the same targets\&. Given that the host
scanme\&.nmap\&.org
.\" scanme.nmap.org
is at the IP address 64\&.13\&.134\&.52, the specification scanme\&.nmap\&.org/16 would send probes to the 65,536 IP addresses between 64\&.13\&.0\&.0 and 64\&.13\&.255\&.255\&. The smallest allowed value is /0, which targets the whole Internet\&. The largest value is /32, which targets just the named host or IP address because all address bits are fixed\&.
.\" address ranges
.PP
CIDR notation is short but not always flexible enough\&. For example, you might want to send probes to 192\&.168\&.0\&.0/16 but skip any IPs ending with \&.0 or \&.255 because they may be used as subnet network and broadcast addresses\&. Ncrack supports this through octet range addressing\&. Rather than specify a normal IP address, you can specify a comma\-separated list of numbers or ranges for each octet\&. For example, 192\&.168\&.0\-255\&.1\-254 will skip all addresses in the range that end in \&.0 or \&.255, and 192\&.168\&.3\-5,7\&.1 will target the four addresses 192\&.168\&.3\&.1, 192\&.168\&.4\&.1, 192\&.168\&.5\&.1, and 192\&.168\&.7\&.1\&. Either side of a range may be omitted; the default values are 0 on the left and 255 on the right\&. Using
\-
by itself is the same as 0\-255, but remember to use 0\- in the first octet so the target specification doesn\'t look like a command\-line option\&. Ranges need not be limited to the final octets: the specifier will send probes to all IP addresses on the Internet ending in 13\&.37 This sort of broad sampling can be useful for Internet surveys and research\&.
.PP
Ncrack accepts multiple host specifications on the command line, and they don\'t need to be the same type\&. The command
\fBncrack scanme\&.nmap\&.org 192\&.168\&.0\&.0/8 10\&.0\&.0,1,3\-7\&.\-\fR
does what you would expect\&.
.PP
While targets are usually specified on the command lines, the following options are also available to control target selection:
.SH "BUGS"
.\" bugs, reporting
.PP
Like its authors, Ncrack isn\'t perfect\&. But you can help make it better by sending bug reports or even writing patches\&. If Ncrack doesn\'t behave the way you expect, first upgrade to the latest version available from
\m[blue]\fB\%http://ncrack.org\fR\m[]\&. If the problem persists, do some research to determine whether it has already been discovered and addressed\&. Try searching for the error message on our search page at
\m[blue]\fB\%http://insecure.org/search.html\fR\m[]
or at Google\&. Also try browsing the
nmap\-dev
archives at

.\" nmap-dev mailing list
Read this full manual page as well\&. If nothing comes of this, mail a bug report to
nmap\-dev@insecure\&.org
\&. Please include everything you have learned about the problem, as well as what version of Nmap you are running and what operating system version it is running on\&. Problem reports and Ncrack usage questions sent to
nmap\-dev@insecure\&.org
are far more likely to be answered than those sent to Fyodor directly\&. If you subscribe to the nmap\-dev list before posting, your message will bypass moderation and get through more quickly\&. Subscribe at

Code patches to fix bugs are even better than bug reports\&. Basic instructions for creating patch files with your changes are available at
