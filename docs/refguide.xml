    <para>
      Ncrack is an open source tool for network authentication cracking. 
      It was designed for high-speed parallel cracking using a dynamic engine
      that can adapt to different network situations. Ncrack can also be
      extensively fine-tuned for special cases, though the default parameters
      are generic enough to cover almost every situation. It is built on a
      modular architecture that allows for easy extension to support additional
      protocols. While Ncrack's main purpose is to audit the security of large
      networks for default, weak passwords in a rapid, yet reliable way, it can
      also be used to conduct some fairly sophisticated bruteforcing attacks.
    </para>

    <para>
      The output from Ncrack is a list of found credentials, if any, for each
      of the targets specified. Ncrack can also print an interactive status
      report of progress so far and possibly additional debugging information
      that can help track problems, if the user selected that option.
    </para>

    <para>
      A typical Ncrack scan is shown in
      <xref linkend="man-ex-repscan" xrefstyle="select: label nopage" />. 
      The only Ncrack arguments used in this example are the two target IP
      addresses along with the the corresponding ports for each of them. The
      two example ports 21 and 22 are automatically resolved to the default
      services listening on them: ftp and ssh.

    Like its authors, Ncrack isn't perfect. But you can help make
    it better by sending bug reports or even writing patches. If Ncrack
    doesn't behave the way you expect, first upgrade to the latest
    version available from <ulink url="http://ncrack.org"/>. If the
    problem persists, do some research to determine whether it has already
    been discovered and addressed. Try searching for the error message on our
    search page at <ulink url="http://insecure.org/search.html"/> or at
    Google. Also try browsing the <citetitle>nmap-dev</citetitle> archives
    at <ulink url="http://seclists.org/" />.

    Read this full manual page as well. If nothing comes of this, mail a
    bug report to <email>nmap-dev@insecure.org</email>. Please include
    everything you have learned about the problem, as well as what version of
    Nmap you are running and what operating system version it is running on.
    Problem reports and Ncrack usage questions sent to
    <email>nmap-dev@insecure.org</email> are far more likely to be answered
    than those sent to Fyodor directly.  If you subscribe to the nmap-dev
    list before posting, your message will bypass moderation and get through
    more quickly. Subscribe at 
    <ulink url="http://cgi.insecure.org/mailman/listinfo/nmap-dev"/>.
  </para>

  <para>
    Code patches to fix bugs are even better than bug reports.
    Basic instructions for creating patch files with your changes are
    available at <ulink url="http://nmap.org/data/HACKING" />. Patches may
    be sent to <citetitle>nmap-dev</citetitle> (recommended) or to Fyodor
    directly.
