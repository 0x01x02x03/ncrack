    <para>
      Ncrack is an open source tool for network authentication cracking. 
      It was designed for high-speed parallel cracking using a dynamic engine
      that can adapt to different network situations. Ncrack can also be
      extensively fine-tuned for special cases, though the default parameters
      are generic enough to cover almost every situation. It is built on a
      modular architecture that allows for easy extension to support additional
      protocols. While Ncrack's main purpose is to audit the security of large
      networks for default, weak passwords in a rapid, yet reliable way, it can
      also be used to conduct some fairly sophisticated bruteforcing attacks.
    </para>

    <para>
      The output from Ncrack is a list of found credentials, if any, for each
      of the targets specified. Ncrack can also print an interactive status
      report of progress so far and possibly additional debugging information
      that can help track problems, if the user selected that option.
    </para>

    <para>
      A typical Ncrack scan is shown in
      <xref linkend="man-ex-repscan" xrefstyle="select: label nopage" />. 
      The only Ncrack arguments used in this example are the two target IP
      addresses along with the the corresponding ports for each of them. The
      two example ports 21 and 22 are automatically resolved to the default
      services listening on them: ftp and ssh.

    <title>Target Specification</title>
    <indexterm significance="normal"><primary>target specification</primary>
    </indexterm>

     <para>
       Everything on the Ncrack command-line that isn't an option (or an
       option argument) is treated as a target host specification. The
       simplest case is to specify a target IP address or a hostname.
     </para>

     <para>
       Sometimes you wish to crack a whole network of adjacent hosts.
       For this, Ncrack supports CIDR-style <indexterm significance="normal">
       <primary>CIDR (Classless Inter-Domain Routing)</primary></indexterm>
       addressing. You can append /<replaceable>numbits</replaceable> to an
       IPv4 address or hostname and Ncrack will try to crack every IP
       address for which the first numbits are the same as for the
       reference IP or hostname given. For example, 192.168.10.0/24 would
       send probes to the 256 hosts between 192.168.10.0
       <literal moreinfo="none">11000000 10101000 00001010 00000000</literal>)
       and 192.168.10.255 (binary:
       <literal moreinfo="none">11000000 10101000 00001010 11111111</literal>),
       inclusive. 192.168.10.40/24 would crack exactly the same targets.
       Given that the host <literal moreinfo="none">scanme.nmap.org</literal>
       <indexterm significance="normal"><primary>
       <literal moreinfo="none">scanme.nmap.org</literal></primary></indexterm>
       is at the IP address 64.13.134.52, the specification
       scanme.nmap.org/16 would send probes to the 65,536 IP addresses
       between 64.13.0.0 and 64.13.255.255. The smallest allowed value is
       /0, which targets the whole Internet. The largest value is /32,
       which targets just the named host or IP address because all address
       bits are fixed.
      </para>
 
      <indexterm significance="normal"><primary>address ranges</primary>
      </indexterm>
      <para>
        CIDR notation is short but not always flexible enough.  For example,
        you might want to send probes to 192.168.0.0/16 but skip any IPs
        ending with .0 or .255 because they may be used as subnet network
        and broadcast addresses. Ncrack supports this through octet range
        addressing. Rather than specify a normal IP address, you can specify
        a comma-separated list of numbers or ranges for each octet. For
        example, 192.168.0-255.1-254 will skip all addresses in the range
        that end in .0 or .255, and 192.168.3-5,7.1 will target the four
        addresses 192.168.3.1, 192.168.4.1, 192.168.5.1, and 192.168.7.1.
        Either side of a range may be omitted; the default values are 0 on
        the left and 255 on the right. Using
        <literal moreinfo="none">-</literal> by itself is the same as 0-255,
        but remember to use 0- in the first octet so the target
        specification doesn't look like a command-line option. Ranges need
        not be limited to the final octets: the specifier will send probes
        to all IP addresses on the Internet ending in 13.37 This sort of
        broad sampling can be useful for Internet surveys and research.
      </para>
 
      <para>
        Ncrack accepts multiple host specifications on the command line,
        and they don't need to be the same type. The command
        <command moreinfo="none">ncrack scanme.nmap.org
        192.168.0.0/8 10.0.0,1,3-7.- -p22</command> does what you would expect.
      </para>
 
      <para>
        While targets are usually specified on the command lines, the
        following options are also available to control target selection:
      </para>

          <para>Reads target specifications from
          <replaceable>inputfilename</replaceable>. Passing a huge
          list of hosts is often awkward on the command line, yet it
          is a common desire. For example, you might want to crack
          a list of very specific servers that have been specified for
          penetration testing. Simply generate the list
          of hosts to crack and pass that filename to Ncrack as an
          argument to the <option>-iL</option> option. Entries can be
          in any of the formats accepted by Ncrack on the command line
          (IP address, hostname, CIDR, octet ranges or Ncrack's special
          host-service syntax. Each
          entry must be separated by one or more spaces, tabs, or
          newlines.  You can specify a hyphen (<literal>-</literal>)
          as the filename if you want Ncrack to read hosts from standard
          input rather than an actual file. Note, however, that if hosts
          are specified without any service, you will have to also provide
          services/ports for the targets using the <option>-p</option>
          option.

          octet ranges, etc.  This can be useful when the network you
          wish to scan includes untouchable mission-critical servers,

          extending Ncrack for additional modules). In addition, Ncrack is
          shipped with various username and password lists, some of which
          are used by default in case the user doesn't specify ones of his
          own. All these files are normally copied during the installation

          option, will force Ncrack to start searching for these files in
          specified directory. If the files aren't found, then it will continue
          searching in the directory specified by the NCRACKDIR environmental
          variable <envar>NCRACKDIR</envar> (if it is defined).

    been discovered and addressed. Try searching for the error message on our
