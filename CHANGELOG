                  -- [ Ncrack Changelog ] --


Ncrack 0.2ALPHA [2010-06-12]

o Added this CHANGELOG file to the distribution.

o Made changes to Nsock so that Nmap and Ncrack can share it as an external svn
  object. Now Ncrack doesn't need to have a separate copy of Nsock like
  previously, rather it gets a fully updated version straight from the svn
  repository each time. The modifications needed had to do with Ncrack being
  able to give Nsock an option so as not to compile with libpcap (since Ncrack
  doesn't rely or need libpcap).

o Fixed error with timeout (to) as reported at
  http://seclists.org/nmap-dev/2010/q2/450 . It appears that
  nsock_gettimeofday() was the culprit as nsock doesn't record the time as
  frequently and as a result, the 'now' time was a bit behind than the real
  one. This led to a negative value as a result of the timeval subtraction.
 
o Fixed bug which caused an endless loop before Ncrack could exit properly.
  This bug was reported at http://seclists.org/nmap-dev/2010/q2/746

o Fixed several memory leaks with the help of Valgrind. Also conducted a
  Valgrind test for all modules. A report on a big memleak was made here:
  http://seclists.org/nmap-dev/2010/q1/1140

o Fixed configure-script issue where it was called twice for each of the
  libraries on which Ncrack relies. The fix has really sped up installation
  speed.

o Ncrack now has the capability of interactively printing the credentials
  found so far whenever the user presses the 'p' key. It will print the
  username/password pairs in a way similar to the one it uses to print the
  results when it finishes cracking. Also, when -v (verbose) mode has been
  specified, Ncrack prints any credentials found at the time they are
  discovered.

o Added real-life examples to -h. Ncrack now prints supported modules with
  -h and -V (manually added).

o Updated Ncrack license terms for year 2010.

o Added experimental pop3(s) support - patch initially made by Bucsay Balazs
  and then modified by me

o Added cleanup function for modules. This is made possible by a function
  pointer (ops_free) in the Connection class, that deallocates all internal
  struct members of misc_info . Since these are module-specific data, each
  module should initialize this function upon first invokation.

o Added snprintf function to Buf class. This is really handy, because you can
  now do multiple I/O operations in one go.

o Added two separate iobufs for Connection class, 1 for inbound and 1 for
  outbound data. Removed older iobuf system and replaced it with the inbuf and
  outbuf systems for every module. These buffers allow differentiation between
  data that is inbound and outbound respectively.

o Added --resume option, which allows users to pause (usually be pressing
  Ctrl+C) and later restore a cracking session through a file with the saved
  state. The ncrack restoration file will be saved at .ncrack/ under the home
  user's directory for *nix systems and inside the user's profile directory 
  (normally under C:\Documents and Settings\<user>\.ncrack\) in Windows. The
  name format is restore.<date>_<time> e.g: restore.2009-11-1_10-10 . The time
  cannot be in XX:XX format because Windows doesn't allow colons in filenames.

o Integrated Solar Designer's list as a separate file and compiled optimal
  default password list by merging the top 500 myspace 
  and top 500 phpbb passwords with Solar Designer's jtr list.

o Added --user and --pass options for command-line wordlist specification.

o Microsoft couldn't reproduce the issue with the Windows RST bug as described
  at http://seclists.org/nmap-dev/2009/q2/774 . Its response is in the bug
  ticket I opened here:
  https://connect.microsoft.com/WNDP/feedback/ViewFeedback.aspx?FeedbackID=479640
  According to them, it's the antivirus messing with the network stack, so
  disabling it is the only solution.

o Implemented -iN option, through which Ncrack can get target input from Nmap's
  -oN normal output format. This has also been later updated to take account of
  the latest Nmap -oN format.

o Implemented -iX option, which allows Ncrack to get target input from Nmap's
  -oX XML output format.

o Fixed issue where compilation would fail at linking phase when OpenSSL is
  not installed in system, due to undefined reference of ncrack_ssh()


Ncrack 0.01ALPHA [2009-08-10]

o First public release of Ncrack.
